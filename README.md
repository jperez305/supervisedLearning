# Assignment 1: Supervised Learning

The goal of this project is to gain a better understainding of the different supervised learning algorithms and how the parameters relate to your predictive goal. Here we look at Decision trees, kNN, neural network SVM and boosted trees:

Dataset 1: Mushroom classification - Custom dataset, original was from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification I added noise to the dataset so you must download mushrooms.csv file from this repository. 
Dataset 2: Survey Response (city/Rural) Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey
            You only ned the responses.csv file from this kaggle site
## Running the code:
You must have python 3.6 and the following packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, random, imblearn

To run the python script, you must first edit the location of the files to where you are storing them on your local machine. 
Once this is done, it's a simple as just running the code in a python ide of your choosing.
